    <h2>Oh noes! Something's not right!</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      If you followed a link from the versions dropdown menu, that means that the
      page you're looking for doesn't exist in this version!

  <p>Is it a Review App you're looking for? If yes, then did you <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/writing_documentation.html#previewing-the-changes-live">read the docs</a>? Follow these steps to debug:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Did you follow the URL from the merge request widget?</strong> If yes, then check if
      the link is the same as the one in the job output. It can happen that if the
      branch name slug is longer than 35 characters, it is automatically
      truncated. That means that the merge request widget will not show the proper
      URL due to a limitation of how <code>environment: url</code> works, but you can find the
      real URL from the output of the <code>review-docs-deploy</code> job.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Did you follow the URL from the job output?</strong> If yes, then it means that
      either the site is not yet deployed or something went wrong with the remote
      pipeline. Give it a few minutes and it should appear online, otherwise you
      can check the status of the remote pipeline from the link in the job output.
      If the pipeline failed or got stuck, drop a line in the <code>#docs</code> chat channel.</li>
  </ol>
